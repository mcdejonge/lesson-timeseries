# Lecture Time Series + Workshop

This is the repo for a lecture + workshop on Time Series.

It is part of the Data Exploration course for the Master of Applied Data Science at HAN University of Applied Sciences.

It consists of one lecture (including demos) and one workshop lesson.

## Lesson goals

- For the lecture: the student recognizes time series data as a distinct type of data and knows the techniques for making predictions using this type of data (leads to the "data analytics" final qualification).
- For the workshop: the student applies time series forecasting techniques to make predictions using a time series data set. This lesson goal relates to final qualification "data analytics" (leads to the "data analytics" final qualification).
